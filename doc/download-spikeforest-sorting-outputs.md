# Downloading SpikeForest sorting outputs

First follow the instructions [here](./download-spikeforest-data.md) to set up a kachery daemon and install labbox-ephys.

Once you are joined to the proper channel, you can download the SpikeForest sorting output JSON file and then load individual sorting outputs.
See [this example script](../examples/load_spikeforest_sorting_outputs.py).
